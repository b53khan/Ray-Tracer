To build and run A5, execute the following:
    $ cd A4/
    $ premake4 gmake
    $ make
    $ cd Assets
    $ .././A4 ani.lua

Objectives:
    1. Texture mapping
    2. Shadows
    3. Reflections
    4. Two interacting primitives
    5. Sound
    6. Anti-aliasing (extra)

NOTE: I did not submit my A4 so I have implemented anti-aliasing as an extra feature 
      from A4. I have not included it in the animation video because the rendering was 
      too heavy for my computer to handle and it could only generate a few frames.
