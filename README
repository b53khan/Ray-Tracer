# 📸 Ray Tracer: Animated Scene Rendering
**Author:** Beenish Khan  

A high-performance C++ Ray Tracer developed to simulate realistic light transport and physics-based interactions to create a 10s 3D Lua animation. This project follows the architecture of **"Ray Tracing in One Weekend"** and extends it with advanced rendering objectives.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Texture Mapping:** Spherical UV mapping using the LodePNG library.
2. **Shadows:** Shadow ray casting with Epsilon offsets.
3. **Reflections:** Recursive ray tracing for mirror-like surfaces.
4. **Two Interacting Primitives:** Physics-based interaction (bouncing ball and plane).
5. **Sound:** Synchronized audio for spatial interaction.
6. **Anti-Aliasing (Extra):** Multi-sampling per pixel for smoothed edges.
